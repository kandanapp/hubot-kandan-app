Hubot-Kandan App
================
An easily deployed Hubot for Kandan, running in the cloud. A regular Algonquin round table of ribaldry and wit.

Installation
============
You'll need the heroku gem installed with Heroku. Then:

    git clone https://github.com/kandanapp/hubot-kandan-app.git
    cd hubot-kandan-app

    # Add Hubot scripts to ./scripts if you want.
    # Visit the [Hubot Script Catalog](http://hubot-script-catalog.herokuapp.com/)
    # for some cool tricks you can teach your Hubot.

    # Push and scale
    heroku create --stack cedar
    git push heroku master --force
    heroku ps:scale app=1

    # *************** EDIT TO ADD YOUR VARIABLES *************** #
    # Add any other config variables your extra scripts may need #
    heroku config:add HUBOT_KANDAN_CHANNELS=1 HUBOT_KANDAN_HOST=kandan-host HUBOT_KANDAN_TOKEN=kandan-token 

You can get your `HUBOT_KANDAN_HOST` and `HUBOT_KANDAN_TOKEN` variables on kandanapp by clicking on App Settings while in Kandan:

Or if you're running it elsewhere, use the `rake kandan:hubot_access_key`

Done! Never feel lonely again with your own robotic companion.

Other cloud providers
=====================
Installation instructions for other cloud providers are readily accepted, but be sure keep them as close to copy/paste as possible.
