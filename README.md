Hubot-Kandan App
================
An easily deployed Hubot for Kandan, running in the cloud. A regular Algonquin round table of ribaldry and wit.

Installation
============
You'll need the heroku gem installed with Heroku. Then:

    git clone https://github.com/kandanapp/hubot-kandan-app.git
    cd hubot-kandan-app

    # Add Hubot scripts to ./scripts if you want.
    # Visit the [Hubot Script Catalog](http://hubot-script-catalog.herokuapp.com/)
    # for some cool tricks you can teach your Hubot.

    # Push and scale
    heroku create --stack cedar
    git push heroku master --force
    heroku ps:scale app=1

    # *************** EDIT TO ADD YOUR VARIABLES *************** #
    # Add any other config variables your extra scripts may need #
    heroku config:add HUBOT_KANDAN_CHANNELS=1 HUBOT_KANDAN_HOST=kandan-host HUBOT_KANDAN_TOKEN=kandan-token 

You can get your `HUBOT_KANDAN_HOST` and `HUBOT_KANDAN_TOKEN` variables on kandanapp by clicking on App Settings while in Kandan:

Heroku will idle processes after an hour of inactivity, so the Hubot
will ping itself periodically if you add the `HEROKU_URL` environment
variable pointing to your app's instance URL:

    heroku config:set HEROKU_URL=http://rosemary-britches-123.herokuapp.com

Finally, Some scripts needs Redis to work, Heroku offers an addon called
RedisToGo, which has a free nano plan. To use it run:

    heroku addons:add redistogo:nano

And add the `redis-brain.coffee` hubot-script (see section below on
Hubot Scripts).

If needed, refer to the [full Hubot Heroku installation
instructions](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md).

Or if you're running it elsewhere, use the `rake kandan:hubot_access_key`

Done! Never feel lonely again with your own robotic companion.

Optional configuration
======================

If your Kandan app is running on a non-standard port, or using SSL, you
may configure the connection with additional environment variables (be
sure to add these to Heroku or wherever your Kandan Hubot app is
running):

    HUBOT_KANDAN_PORT=443
    HUBOT_KANDAN_PROTOCOL=https

Other cloud providers
=====================
Installation instructions for other cloud providers are readily accepted, but be sure keep them as close to copy/paste as possible.

Hubot Scripts
=============

Hubot comes with many user-contributed scripts that may be installed. To
install Hubot Scripts, add the following to `"dependencies"` in the
package.json file:

    "hubot-scripts": ""

And run `npm install`.

Then add the names of any scripts you like from the
[hubot-scripts](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts) repository to
the array in the hubot-scripts.json file, such as:

    ["redis-brain.coffee", "tweet.coffee", "shipit.coffee"]
